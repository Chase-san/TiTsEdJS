# TitsEdJS

## History

So they changed TiTs from Flash to HTML/JS. This has made a lot of people very
angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. However personally, I think it was
a great move.

However I do not really play TiTs much, and I gave my previous editor TiTsEd
over to someone else to manage since I have no interest in doing so myself.

However there has been much complaint about a lack of an editor, and I get
messages from time to time about adapting TiTsEd to work with the new JS based
TiTs.

This I consider to be a terrible idea, since the platform TiTsEd was built
upon is rather niche (Windows, so maybe not so niche) and has been a great
source of annoyance to me for many years and people have contacted me regularly
over it not working on thier old Amiga or some such.

## How to use this tool?

Good question! You copy and past it into your console for now. I'm working on
the problem, but there is no simple solution due to XSS security.

For the moment you can simply copy and paste the following into your browsers
javscript console.

`(function(){var s=document.createElement("script");s.src="https://chase-san.github.io/TiTsEdJS/titsed.js";document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(s)})()`

After that it's fairly straight forward,a dn if you don't understand it, it's
really not my problem. Why is that you ask? That is due to the fancy disclosure
that follows.

## Disclosure

You use this entirely at your own risk, and if it so happens to do something
from your use, I am in no way liable for any it, good or bad.
